      Cornerstone Core
      </h3>

      <p>
      Cornerstone is an open source project with a goal to deliver a complete web based medical imaging platform. This repository contains the Cornerstone Core component which is a lightweight JavaScript library for displaying medical images in modern web browsers that support the HTML5 canvas element. Cornerstone Core is not meant to be a complete application itself, but instead a component that can be used as part of larger more complex applications. See the <a href="http://chafey.github.io/cornerstoneDemo/">CornerstoneDemo</a> for an example of using the various Cornerstone libraries to build a simple study viewer.
      </p>

      <p>
      Cornerstone Core is agnostic to the actual container used to store image pixels as well as the transport mechanism used to get the image data. In fact, Cornerstone Core itself has no ability to read/parse or load images and instead depends on one or more <a href="https://github.com/chafey/cornerstone/wiki/ImageLoader">ImageLoaders</a> to function. The goal here is to avoid constraining developers to work within a single container and transport (e.g. DICOM) since images are stored in a variety of formats (including proprietary). By providing flexibility with respect to the container and transport, the highest performance image display may be obtained as no conversion to an alternate container or transport is required. It is hoped that developers feel empowered to load images from any type of image container using any kind of transport. See the <a href="https://github.com/chafey/cornerstoneWADOImageLoader">CornerstoneWADOImageLoader</a> project for an example of a DICOM WADO based Image Loader.
      </p>

      <p>Cornerstone Core is agnostic to the exact interaction paradigm being used.  It does not include any mouse, touch or
      keyboard bindings to manipulate the various image properties such as scale, translation or ww/wc.  The goal here
      is to avoid constraining developers using this library to fit into a given ui paradigm.  It is hoped that developers
      are empowered to create new paradigms possibly using new input mechanisms to interact with medical images (e.g.
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect">Kinect</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer">Accelerometer</a>.
      Cornerstone does provide a set of API's allowing manipulation of the image properties via javascript.
      See the <a href="https://github.com/chafey/cornerstoneTools">CornerstoneTools</a> library for an example of common tools built on top of
      Cornerstone.
